# 2022-Hackathon-on-Cycling-and-Sustainable-Mobility
The participant would be in our Belgian Prime Ministerâ€™s shoes. The idea is that our Prime Minister wants to improve bicycle use and infrastructures in Belgium. However, they have a limited budget, and they want to focus first on the city/region where it will have the most significant impact. Thanks to data, the goal is to select which place is the best to invest and promote bicycling and explain why through visualisation, data analysis and business logic. The participant could take different angles to make their analysis, but we would give them some ideas. For example, to analyse the situation regarding the level of actual development (i.e., where infrastructure is lacking), the number of bicycle accidents, who is using current infrastructures and when they use it, the level of pollution in some areas, etc. We are open to creativity.
