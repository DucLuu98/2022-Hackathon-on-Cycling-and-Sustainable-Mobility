# The challenge
## The case
The participant would be in our Belgian Prime Minister’s shoes. The idea is that our Prime
Minister wants to improve bicycle use and infrastructures in Belgium. However, they
have a limited budget, and they want to focus first on the city/region where it will have
the most significant impact.
Thanks to data, the goal is to select which place is the best to invest and promote
bicycling and explain why through visualisation, data analysis and business logic. The
participant could take different angles to make their analysis, but we would give them
some ideas. For example, to analyse the situation regarding the level of actual
development (i.e., where infrastructure is lacking), the number of bicycle accidents, who
is using current infrastructures and when they use it, the level of pollution in some areas,
etc. We are open to creativity.
